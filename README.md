Investigating User Experience Factors in Children's Mobile Gaming Applications Using Sentiment Analysis
Overview: This project explores the user experience of children aged 5-10 in mobile gaming applications through sentiment analysis of user reviews. The objective is to identify the factors that influence gaming experiences and understand their impacts on cognitive development, emotional well-being, and behavior.

Significance:
Mobile gaming is a dominant form of entertainment for children, and its design and content can have profound effects on their development. Unlike educational apps, which are often designed with specific learning objectives, gaming apps can present complex challenges such as addictive behaviors, excessive screen time, and emotional stress. Understanding these factors is crucial for creating games that are not only engaging but also promote positive developmental outcomes.

Methodology:
The project employs sentiment analysis to systematically analyze user reviews of popular children's games. By categorizing sentiments expressed in these reviews—whether positive, negative, or neutral—we aim to uncover patterns related to game design, usability, and its effects on young users. This analysis provides insights into common issues faced by players, such as problematic features, user interface challenges, and the impact of in-game rewards.

Findings:
The study highlights several critical aspects:

Prevalence of Gaming Addiction: A significant percentage of children exhibit signs of gaming addiction, which can impact cognitive development, emotional stability, and social interactions.
Impact on Cognitive and Emotional Development: Excessive gaming and problematic design features can lead to delays in cognitive development, increased anxiety, and behavioral issues.
Opportunities for Improvement: By identifying specific areas where games can be improved, such as incorporating educational elements, encouraging healthy habits, and enhancing user interfaces, the study aims to provide actionable recommendations for game developers.
Conclusion:
This project underscores the importance of applying Human Factors Engineering principles to digital game design. By focusing on user experience and addressing the negative impacts identified through sentiment analysis, we can contribute to creating healthier, more balanced gaming environments. The goal is to enhance the overall gaming experience for children while supporting their cognitive and emotional well-being, ultimately contributing to a better and more responsible digital landscape.
